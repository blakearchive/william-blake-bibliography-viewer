This project is a full-stack web app for serving a very large PDF (10,000 pages) with bookmarks and anchors. The backend (Python/FastAPI) extracts and serves PDF content, while the frontend (React) provides navigation, search, and page viewing. Retain the styling and structure of the PDF in the viewer. Prioritize performance and usability for large documents.
